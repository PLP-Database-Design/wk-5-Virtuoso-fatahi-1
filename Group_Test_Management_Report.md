## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R-01 | Leaderboard | Incorrect sorting → wrong top-3 shown | Medium | High | High | Add unit tests for sorting, snapshot after updates |
| R-02 | Reset Game | State not fully cleared → residual score persists | Low | High | Medium | Add integration test for reset; ensure reset function resets all relevant state variables |
| R-03 | Bonus Round | Bonus multiplier applied incorrectly (off-by-one) | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add boundary tests for round counters; add logging around multiplier calculation |
| R-04 | UI Responsiveness | Controls overlap at small widths → usability degradation | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add responsive checks in Chrome DevTools; add simple CSS fixes or constraints |
| R-05 | Input Validation | Invalid characters break scoring or crash the app | Low | High | Medium | Sanitize and validate inputs; add negative tests for special characters and scripts |
| R-06 | Persistence | localStorage or corruption prevents leaderboard save | Low | Low | Low | Limit stored entries; implement graceful fallback (in-memory) and user notification |

### Risk Coverage

- Total identified risks: 6
- Risks covered by test cases: 6
- Tested Risks Percent: 100%
- Untested Risks Percent: 0%

## Reflection

### Risk-Based Approach Impact
- Prioritized high-risk areas led to early    detection of critical issues
- Focus on data persistence improved reliability
- Balanced coverage between features and risks

## Sign-Off

We certify that all planned testing activities have been completed according to the test plan and risk assessment.

### Test Cases

| ID | Feature | Objective | Steps (summary) | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Risk Link |
|----|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| TC-01 | Leaderboard | Verify top-3 sorting logic | Submit scores 70,80,180 → open leaderboard | Scores shown 180,80,70| 180,80,70 | Pass | R-01 |
| TC-02 | Reset Game | Verify Reset clears score & progress | Play to score >0 → Click Reset | Score=0, puzzle index resets | Score & index reset | Pass | R-02 |
| TC-03 | Bonus Round | Verify every 3rd puzzle applies x2 multiplier | Complete puzzles 1–3 and note points | Puzzle 3 points = base ×2 | Multiplier applied correctly | Pass | R-03 |
| TC-04 | Input Validation (Negative) | Ensure invalid inputs don't crash app | Submit "<script>" as answer | App sanitizes/blocks input; no crash | App threw an error | Fail | R-05 |
| TC-05 | Leaderboard (Boundary) | Verify only top 3 scores persist | Submit >3 scores with varying values | Only top-3 are stored | Top-3 retained | Pass | R-01 |
| TC-06 | Usability | New user can complete tutorial puzzle | Observe new user attempting tutorial | User completes with minor confusion (notes) | not Completed; no notes recorded | fail | R-04 |
| TC-07 | Reset + Persistence (Negative) | Reset does not clear leaderboard | Save score → Reset → check leaderboard | Leaderboard remains intact | Leaderboard intact | Pass | R-02, R-06 |
| TC-08 | Performance | App responsiveness under diffrent screen sizes | adapt to diffrent screen sizes | UI responds properly, no glitch| Responsive; acceptable | Pass | R-04 |
